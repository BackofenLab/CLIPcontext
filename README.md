# CLIPcontext
CLIPcontext takes genomic RBP binding regions identified by CLIP-seq, maps them to the transcriptome, 
and retrieves the region sequences with both genomic and transcript sequence context.



## Installation

To install CLIPcontext, simply clone the repository and use the Python script within the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/michauhl/CLIPcontext.git
cd CLIPcontext
python CLIPcontext.py -h
```

### Dependencies
Dependencies for CLIPcontext are as follows:

- python3 (tested with version 3.7.3)
- [bedtools](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/releases)  (tested with version 2.26.0)
- [twoBitToFa](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/twoBitToFa) executable in PATH

### Dataset requirements
CLIPcontext was implemented to work with and tested on human datasets retrieved from [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). If you want to use CLIPcontext for different organisms or with datasets from different ressources, feel free to open up an issue.

The following datasets need to be obtained for running CLIPcontext:
- A genome .2bit file for extracting genomic sequences (for hg38 assembly click [here](https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.2bit))
- A .gtf genomic annotations file from Ensembl (see [download page](http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html))
- A transcript sequences FASTA file from Ensembl (see [download page](http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html))
- A list of transcript IDs which defines the transcriptome to map to

### Test run
First we obtain the necessary datasets:
```
cd data/
wget https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.2bit
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-98/fasta/homo_sapiens/cdna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-98/fasta/homo_sapiens/ncrna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.ncrna.fa.gz
cat Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.ncrna.fa.gz > Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.ncrna.fa.gz
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-98/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.98.gtf.gz
cd ..
```
